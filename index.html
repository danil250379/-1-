  <h1>Carry</h1>
  <p>A Carry is the hero that the team rallies around in the late game. The role's name is derived from the act of "carrying" a team, which is to bear the responsibility of leading the team to victory. The carry is expected to have the largest contribution to the team, and is critical in winning team fights. Carries typically lack early game power, but scale to be stronger in the late game. They are highly dependent on items to be successful. Carries often have a built-in farming mechanism to achieve this. Carries also rely on strong and fast physical attacks, but this is not always the case. Having more than one carry can potentially cause competition within your team for resources, which typically results in a number of underpowered carries. For certain team compositions, it is highly recommended that a team have only one hard carry (a hero with strong carry potential but weaker potential in other roles) and as the game progresses the hard carry will secure the majority of the kills. A semi carry (hero that has a bit less carry potential but stronger potential in other roles) that has gained a big enough gold advantage can also end up being the main damage dealer for the team. Carries are typically sent to the safe lane in the early game with one or more supports to protect them until they are strong enough to farm independently.</p>
  <h2>Midder</h2>
  <p>Mider is a player who is responsible for the line in the center. In this position, he stands alone, which follows even from the part of the title of his role - “Solo”. As for its main characteristics, Midera can be called a Dota 2 playmaker, since he accumulates experience points faster and reaches a higher level than other heroes. Solo Mead has good gold mining abilities. In addition, he fights perfectly and can give a decent rebuff to enemies even at the very beginning of the game. Often, Meader starts the main movement on the map and keeps a good game pace.
  Heroes most suitable for the role of Solo Mead: Dragon Knight, Storm Spirit, Templar Assassin, Puck, Mirana, Lina, Tinker, Sniper, Razor, Zeus, Viper. These heroes have very powerful abilities for attacking magic, excellent mobility, as well as excellent gold mining skills and experience.

  <h3>Hardliner</h3>
  <p>The role of a player taking a Hardliner position is that he must stand on the so-called “open” line. This line is very close to enemy heroes. In such circumstances, it is extremely difficult to mine gold and earn experience points. The only thing that can be in this position is that the hero has such abilities as evasion, quick movement, and invisibility. Hardliner, the player in this situation will have to hold out for a long time.
  As for the main functions of the Offlane hero, they are as follows:
  <ul type="square">
  <li>A hero who plays in this position;</li>
  <li>Responsible for acquiring artifacts for the team;</li>
  <li>Distract yourself from enemies.</li>
  </ul>
  Based on the above, we can say that the Offlainer in Dota 2 is the second playmaker. He must directly influence the outcome of the entire battle.</p>
  <h4>SemiSupport</h4>
  <p>All players in the Support position are responsible for all kinds of support that must be provided to the leading roles players when passing the Dota 2 card. Their main function is to provide all team members with the most comfortable conditions, as well as create as much inconvenience to enemy heroes as possible. Supporters occupy two positions in DotA: fourth and fifth. The task of the “fours” or, as they are also called, roome-heroes is to move around the map in parallel killing enemies, exercise control over the runes, etc. Unlike the helpers of the Fives, they are more useful for the team, especially in the later stages of the game. As for the heroes who are most suitable for the role of Seven-Support, in principle, you can choose any character, the main thing is that he has the skills "Stun", "Slow", as well as skills related to attacking magic.</p>
  <h5>FullSupport</h5>
  <p>Full Supporters take the lowest value, fifth position in the game. Often they are attached to one particular line and provide support to the leading character fixed on it, and also protect their core hero from enemy attacks. In addition, players playing the role of Full Support provide other team members with a review of the wards, purchase a courier, and also purchase all consumables that the team will need in the match.
  For this role, characters that have a good supply of spells that can come in handy at different stages of the game are most suitable. As well as heroes who do not need a lot of game items and gold to carry out their basic functions. The role of Full Support is often assumed by captains. A prime example of this are Sonneiko, Puppey, Solo and KuRoKy.
  To summarize, I want to add that knowing the roles in DotA 2 helps a lot to make the most accurate bets. It is important to know how the positions were distributed among the players within the team, what were the replacements and permutations in the positions, etc. All this is taken into account when making a high-quality forecast for the upcoming game.</p>
